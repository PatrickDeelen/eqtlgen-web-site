The eQTLGen Consortium has been set up to investigate the genetic architecture of blood gene expression and to understand the genetic underpinnings of complex traits.

## Aims

The aims of our consortium are:

-   Facilitate the collaboration and data harmonization between different blood eQTL cohorts.
-   To take advantage of the high power of consortium and identify weak genetic effects on blood gene expression.
-   Provide a framework where consortium members and external collaborators can pursue their specific scientific interests and to propose side-projects.
-   In the form of summary statistics, provide the scientific community a valuable resource which can be used for interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), for the development of novel methods and for other scientific projects.
-   Integrate our results with other QTL consortia, in order to cross-validate the findings and better entangle the molecular mechanisms leading to the formation of complex traits.

## Active projects

`r library(emo); emo::ji("exclamation")`Currently we are working on the [eQTLGen phase II analyses](projects.html#eqtlgen-phase-ii-global-eqtl-analysis): highly-powered *genome-wide* eQTL meta-analysis in blood. This project dramatically expands our previous work where we tested, in addition to *cis*-eQTLs, *trans*-eQTLs for a limited subset of \~10,000 trait-associated SNPs. We plan to conduct such genome-wide meta-analysis on as many blood-based cohorts as possible.

Resulting genome-wide association profiles on gene expression would enable to address many relevant scientific questions. Most simple example: with such data, you can interpret your GWAS locus by finding potentially relevant genes from all over the genome, not only in the near vicinity of trait-associated locus.

Therefore, if you have blood-based eQTL cohort, please consider [joining](collaboration.html) our effort! Please find the details and analysis cookbook from [here](eQTLGen-p2-cookbook.html).

If you know any blood-based eQTL cohort not yet joined our consortium, please drop us a line with the reference and/or contact.

## Previous work

Previously we have conducted *cis*-eQTL, targeted *trans*-eQTL and eQTS analysis in up to 31,684 blood and PBMC samples from 37 individual cohorts from eQTLGen Consortium (eQTLGen phase I). In this project, we tested the subset of \~10,000 trait-related variants for the associations with the expression of distal genes (*trans*).
